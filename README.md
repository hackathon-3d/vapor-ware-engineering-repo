Sparc Team:Vapor-ware Engineering

===============
This repo is a demo of our efforts to make a winning sparc-hackathon(3) contest-app.  Information on our team and the contest can be gleaned from <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/sparc_hackathon_csclug">here</a>

To release the compiled app, use the "release.keystore" file with "vaporware" as the alias and pass="password"
